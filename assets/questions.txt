when hot magma cools and hardens, it forms?
when magma reaches the Earth's surface and flows from volcanoes it is called ____
_____ from magma BELOW the surface; it is also slowly cooled magma so it has large grains.
_____formed as lava cools ON THE SURFACE of Earth; also, it is exposed to air and cools quickly so it usually has pores and is very lightweight.
Dense dark colored rocks that form from magma that is rich in iron and magnesium.what is the  type of igneous rock?
What is an example of a intrusive basaltic rock?
What is an example of a extrusive basaltic rock (2 examples)
light colored rocks of a lower density than basaltic. the magma it is formed from contains a lot of silica
what is an example of a intrusive granitic rock?
What is an example of an extrusive granitic rock? (3 examples)
rocks that have changed because of changes in temperature and pressure or the presence of hot, watery fluids are called _________ (this rock also sometimes forms in parallel layers)
this is the texture in metamorphic rock where the mineral grains grow and rearrange but DO NOT form layers
what are 3 examples of foliated rocks
What are 2 examples of nonfoliated rocks?
forms when sediments are pressed and cemented together, or when minerals form from solutions
loose material such as rock fragments, mineral grains, and bits of shell that have been moved by wind, water, ice, or gravity
made from the broken fragments of other rocks. these loose sediments are compacted and cemented together to form solid rock. (type of sedimentary rock)
pressure from the upper layers pushes down on the lower layers, if the sediments are small they can stick together and form solid rock
occurs when minerals such as quartz, calcite, and hematite are deposited between the pieces of sediment
if the sediments are rounded the rock is called....
if the sediments have sharp angles the rock is called....

what does gravel make? (2 rocks)
Form when dissolved minerals come out of solution (type of sedimentary)
What are two examples of chemical rocks?
Rocks made of the remains of once-living things are called ______ sedimentary rocks.
What is the rock that is made up of shell fragments?
What are the 4 examples of organic sedimentary rocks?
What rock forms when magma cools?
What rock forms when igneous rock experiences weathering and erosion?
What rock forms when sedimentary rock experiences heat and pressure?
