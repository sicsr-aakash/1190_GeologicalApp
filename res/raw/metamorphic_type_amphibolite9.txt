<br/><br/><u><b>9.Amphibolite</b></u><br/><br/>
Amphibolite is a rock composed mostly of amphibole minerals. Usually it's a hornblende
schist like this as hornblende is the commonest amphibole. 
Amphibolite forms when basaltic rock is subjected to higher temperatures (550 &#45; 750 C)
and slightly greater pressure range than that which yields greenschist. Amphibolite
is also the name of a metamorphic facies &#45; a set of minerals that typically forms at
a specific range of temperature and pressure.
