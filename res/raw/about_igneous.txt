<br/><b><u>1.How to Tell Igneous Rocks</u></b> <br/><br/>
The main thing about igneous rocks is that they were once hot enough
to melt.The following traits are all related to that.<ul><li>Because
their mineral grains grew together tightly as the melt cooled,
they are relatively strong rocks.</li><li>They're made of primary
minerals that are mostly black, white or gray.Any other colors they 
may have are pale.</li><li>Their textures generally look like 
something that was baked in an oven.The even texture of coarse-grained
granite is familiar from building stonesor kitchen counters. Fine-grained
lava may look like black bread (including gas bubbles) or dark peanut
brittle (including larger crystals).</li></ul><br/><br/><b><u>2.Origin 
of Igneous Rocks</u></b><br/><br/>The word "igneous" comes from the Latin
for fire, and what igneous rocks have in common is that they formed by the
cooling and crystallization of a melt. This material may have been lava
erupted at the Earth's surface, or magma (unerupted lava) at depths of 
up to a few kilometers, or magma in deeper bodies (plutons). Those three
different settings create three main types of igneous rocks. Rock formed
of lava is called extrusive, rock from shallow magma is called intrusive
and rock from deep magma is called plutonic. The deeper the magma, the 
slower it cools and the larger the mineral crystals that form in it.Igneous
rocks form in three main places: where the tectonic plates pull apart 
(at mid-ocean ridges),where plates come together (at subduction zones) 
and where continents are pushed together,making the Earth's crust thicker
and allowing it to heat to melting. People commonly think of lava and magma
as a liquid, like molten metal, but geologists find that magma is usually
a mush &#45; a partially melted fluid loaded with mineral crystals. As it 
cools, magma crystallizes into a series of minerals, some of which 
crystallize sooner than others. Not just that, but as the minerals 
crystallize, they leave the remaining magma with a changed chemical
composition. Thus a body of magma evolves as it cools, and it also evolves 
as it moves through the crust, interacting with other rocks.Once magma 
erupts as lava, it freezes quickly and preserves a record of its history 
underground that geologists can decipher. Igneous petrology is a very 
complex field, and this article is only the barest outline.
<br/><br/><b><u>3.Where Igneous Rocks Are Found</u></b><br/><br/>
The deep sea floor (the oceanic crust) is made almost entirely of basaltic
rocks,with peridotite underneath in the mantle. Basalts are also erupted
above the Earth's great subduction zones, either in volcanic island arcs 
or along the edges of continents.However, continental magmas tend to be 
less basaltic and more granitic.The continents are the exclusive home of 
granitic rocks. Nearly everywhere on the continents, no matter what rocks
are on the surface, you can drill down and reach granitoid eventually. 
In general, granitic rocks are less dense than basaltic rocks, and thus 
the continents actually float higher than the oceanic crust on top of the 
ultramafic rocks of the Earth's mantle. The behavior and histories of 
granitic rock bodies are among geology's deepest and most intricate mysteries.
