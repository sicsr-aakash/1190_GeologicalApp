<br/>Have you ever wondered what the world would be like 
without rocks? You may not know it, but if we took all the 
rocks away, we would have a miserable life. We use rocks for
roads, metals, jewelry, tombstones, building materals, 
cosmetics, and many, many more things. Most of the famous 
sculptures of the world are made from blocks of 
stones such as granite and marble. Did you know that the Great Wall of 
China and the Taj Mahal are made out of rocks? We also collect rocks as 
a hobby. If we did not have rocks, this earth would be pretty empty. Who
wants an empty earth? Not me!<br/><u><b><center><h1>What is Geology ?</h1>
</center></b></u><br/>Geology is the science comprising the study of
solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the 
processes by which they change. Geology can also refer 
generally to the study of the solid features of any 
celestial body (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).
Geology gives insight into the history of the Earth, as 
it provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the
evolutionary history of life, and past climates. In 
modern times, geology is commercially important for 
mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation 
and for evaluating water resources. It is publicly 
important for the prediction and understanding of 
natural hazards, the remediation of environmental 
problems, and for providing insights into past climate 
change. Geology plays a role in geotechnical engineering 
and is a major academic discipline.<br/>
