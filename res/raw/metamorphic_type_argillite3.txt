<br/><br/><u><b>3.Argillite</b></u><br/><br/>
Argillite is a claystone that has been hardened and slightly altered by heat and pressure.
 The only difference between argillite and slate is that slate has a strong cleavage,
 developed by directional pressure, while argillite has a massive structure.
 Unlike slate, argillite can be carved, and it's sometimes called pipestone.
