<br/><br/><u><b>3.Wacke</b></u><br/><br/>
Wacke ("wacky") is a name for a poorly sorted sandstone, a mixture of grains of sand, 
silt and clay size.Graywacke is a specific type of wacke.
Wacke contains quartz, like other sandstones, but it also has more delicate minerals
 and small fragments of rock (lithics). Its grains are not well rounded. But this hand 
specimen is in fact a graywacke, which refers to a specific origin as well as a wacke composition
 and texture. The British spelling is "greywacke."
Graywacke forms in the seas near fast-rising mountains. 
The streams and rivers from these mountains yield fresh, 
coarse sediment that doesn't fully weather into proper surface minerals.
