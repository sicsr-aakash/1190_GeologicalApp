<br/><br/><u><b>4.Dunite</b></u><br/><br/>
Dunite is a rare rock, a peridotite that is at least 90
percent olivine. It's named for Dun Mountain in New Zealand. 
This is a dunitexenolith in an Arizona basalt.
Dunite is an igneous, plutonic rock, of ultramafic 
composition, with coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. 
The mineral assemblage is greater than 90% olivine, with
minor amounts of other minerals such as pyroxene, chromite
and pyrope. Dunite is the olivine-rich end-member of the 
peridotite group of mantle-derived rocks. Dunite and other 
peridotite rocks are considered the major constituents of 
the Earth'smantle above a depth of about 400 kilometers. 
Dunite is rarely found within continental rocks, but where
it is found, it typically occurs at the base of ophiolite 
sequences where slabs of mantle rock from a subduction zone
have been thrust onto continental crust by obduction during
continental or island arc collisions (orogeny).
