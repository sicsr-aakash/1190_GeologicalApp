<br/><br/><b><u>1.How to Tell Sedimenary Rocks</u></b>
<br/><br/>The main thing about sedimentary rocks is that
they were once sediment &#45; mud and sand and gravel
and clay &#45; and were not greatly changed as they turned into rock.
The following traits are all related to that.
<ul><li>They're generally arranged in layers of sandy or 
clayey material (strata)like those you'll see in excavations 
or in a hole dug in a sand dune</li><li>They're usually the color 
of sediment, that is, light brown to light gray.</li>
<li>They may preserve signs of life and surface activity, like 
fossils, tracks, ripple marks and so on.</li></ul><br/><br/>
<b><u>2.Origin of Sedimenary Rocks</u></b><br/><br/>
You can see that each type of sedimentary rock has a story 
behind it. The beauty of sedimentary rocks is that their strata 
are full of clues to what the past world was like. Those clues 
might be fossils or sedimentary structures such as marks left by 
water currents, mudcracks or more subtle features seen under 
the microscope or in the lab.From these clues we know that most 
sedimentary rocks are of marine origin,usually forming in shallow seas. 
But some sedimentary rocks formed on land:clastic rocks made on the bottoms
of large freshwater lakes or as accumulations of desert sand,
organic rocks in peat bogs or lake beds, and evaporites in playas.
These are called continental or terrigenous (land-formed) sedimentary 
rocks.Sedimentary rocks are rich in geologic history of a special kind.
While igneous and metamorphic rocks also have stories, they involve 
the deep Earth and require intensive work to
decipher. But in sedimentary rocks you can recognize, in very direct
ways, what the world was like in the geologic past.
<br/><br/><b><u>3.Where Sedimentary Rocks Are Found</u></b>
<br/><br/>Sedimentary rocks are formed in places where there has been 
water at one time.  Dead animals, plants, and pieces of rocks or minerals 
are carried to these places by wind, water, ice, or even gravity.  
They are usually dropped off in bodies of water where they sink to 
the bottom.  Little by little they make layers that build on top of 
each other.  This puts pressure on the lower layers.  An example of this
would be tackling in a football game.  The person with the ball is
tackled to the ground and player after player piles on top of him.  
The person at the bottom of this pile of people, will feel the weight 
of all of the people on top of him. The person at the top will not feel
that until someone else piles on top of him.  So, the weight of all of 
the layers of rocks,minerals, dead animal skeletons, and plants pushes
down the lower layers until they harden into rock.  This takes 
millions of years to happen.During that time, the ocean, lake, or other
body of water dries up.  This makes the sedimentary layer, that 
used to be under water, become a surface layer.
