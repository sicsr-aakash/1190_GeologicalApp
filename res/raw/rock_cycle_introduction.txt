<br/><br/>The<b><u> Rock cycle</u></b> is a fundamental concept in geology 
that describes the dynamic transitions through geologic 
time among the three mainrock types: sedimentary, 
metamorphic, and igneous. As the diagram to the right 
illustrates, each of the types of rocks are altered or
destroyed when it is forced out of its equilibrium 
conditions. An igneous rock such as basalt may break 
down and dissolve when exposed to the atmosphere, 
or melt as it is subducted under a continent. Due 
to the driving forces of the rock cycle, plate 
tectonics and the water cycle, rocks do not remain 
in equilibrium and are forced to change as they 
encounter new environments. The rock cycle is an 
illustration that explains how the three rock types 
are related to each other, and how processes change 
from one type to another over time.<br/><br/>
<b><u>The Cycle</u></b><br/><br/>
<b><u>Transition to Igneous</u></b><br/><br/>
When rocks are pushed deep under the Earth's surface, 
they may melt into magma. If the conditions no longer 
exist for the magma to stay in its liquid state, it will
cool and solidify into an igneous rock. A rock that 
cools within the Earth is called intrusive or plutonic
and will cool very slowly, producing a coarse-grained 
texture. As a result of volcanic activity, magma 
(which is called lava when it reaches Earth's surface)
may cool very rapidly while being on Earth's surface 
exposed to the atmosphere and are called extrusive or 
volcanic rocks. These rocks are fine-grained and 
sometimes cool so rapidly that no crystals can form
and result in a natural glass, such as obsidian. 
<br/>Any of the three main types of rocks (igneous, 
sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks) can melt into magma
and cool into igneous rocks.<br/><br/><b><u>1. Post-volcanic 
changes</u></b><br/><br/>Rock masses of igneous origin have no 
sooner cooled than they begin to change. The gases 
with which the magma is charged are slowly dissipated,
lava flows often remain hot and steaming for many 
years. These gases attack the components of the rock
and deposit new minerals in cavities and fissures. 
The zeolites are largely of this origin. Even before 
these "post-volcanic" processes have ceased, 
atmospheric decomposition or weathering begins as 
the mineral components of volcanic and igneous 
rocks are not stable under surface atmospheric 
conditions. Rain, frost, carbonic acid, oxygen 
and other agents operate continuously, and do not
cease until the whole mass has crumbled down and most
of its ingredients have been resolved into new 
products or carried away in aqueous solution. In 
the classification of rocks these secondary changes 
are generally considered unessential: rocks are 
classified and described as if they were ideally 
fresh, though this is rarely the case in nature.
<br/><br/><b><u>2. Secondary changes</u></b><br/><br/>
Epigenetic change (secondary processes) may be 
arranged under a number of headings, each of 
which is typical of a group of rocks or rock-forming
minerals, though usually more than one of these 
alterations will be found in progress in the same 
rock. Silicification, the replacement of the minerals
by crystalline or crypto-crystalline silica, is 
most common in felsic rocks, such asrhyolite, but
is also found in serpentine, etc. Kaolinization 
is the decomposition of the feldspars, which are 
the most common minerals in igneous rocks, into 
kaolin (along with quartz and otherclay minerals); 
it is best shown by granites and syenites. 
Serpentinization is the alteration of olivine 
to serpentine (with magnetite); it is typical 
of peridotites, but occurs in most of the mafic 
rocks. In uralitization secondary hornblende 
replaces augite; this occurs very generally in 
diabases; chloritization is the alteration of 
augite (biotite or hornblende) to chlorite, and 
is seen in many diabases, diorites and greenstones.
Epidotization occurs also in rocks of this group, 
and consists in the development of epidote from 
biotite, hornblende, augite or plagioclase feldspar.
<br/><br/><b><u>Transition to Sedimentary</u></b>
<br/><br/>Rocks exposed to the atmosphere are 
variably unstable and subject to the processes of 
weathering and erosion. Weathering and erosion break
the original rock down into smaller fragments and 
carry away dissolved material. This fragmented 
material accumulates and is buried by additional 
material. While an individual grain of sand is still
a member of the class of rock it was formed from, a 
rock made up of such grains fused together is 
sedimentary. Sedimentary rocks can be formed from 
the lithification of these buried smaller fragments 
(clastic sedimentary rock), the accumulation and 
lithification of material generated by living 
organisms (biogenic sedimentary rock - fossils), 
or lithification of chemically precipitated material
from a mineral bearing solution due toevaporation 
(precipitate sedimentary rock). Clastic rocks can
be formed from fragments broken apart from larger
rocks of any type, due to processes such as erosion
or from organic material, like plant remains. 
Biogenic and precipitate rocks form from the 
deposition of minerals from chemicals dissolved
from all other rock types.<br/><br/>
<b><u>Transition to metamorphic</u></b><br/><br/> 
This diamond is a mineral from within an igneous or 
metamorphic rock that formed at high temperature 
and pressure.Rocks exposed to high temperatures 
and pressures can be changed physically or chemically 
to form a different rock, called metamorphic. 
Regional metamorphism refers to the effects on 
large masses of rocks over a wide area, typically 
associated with mountain building events within 
orogenic belts. These rocks commonly exhibit 
distinct bands of differing mineralogy and colors, 
called foliation. Another main type of metamorphism
is caused when a body of rock comes into contact
with an igneous intrusion that heats up this 
surrounding country rock. This contact 
metamorphism results in a rock that is altered
and re-crystallized by the extreme heat of the 
magma and/or by the addition of fluids from the 
magma that add chemicals to the surrounding 
rock (metasomatism). Any pre-existing type of 
rock can be modified by the processes of metamorphism.
<br/><br/><b><u>Forces that Drive the Rock Cycle</u></b>
<br/><br/><b><u>1. Plate tectonics</u></b><br/><br/>
In 1967, J. Tuzo Wilson published an article in 
Nature describing the repeated opening and closing 
of ocean basins, in particular focusing on the 
current Atlantic Ocean area. This concept, a part
of the plate tectonics revolution, became known 
as the Wilson cycle. The Wilson cycle has had 
profound effects on the modern interpretation 
of the rock cycle as plate tectonics became 
recognized as the driving force for the rock cycle.
<br/><br/><b><u>2. Spreading ridges</u></b><br/><br/>
The start of the cycle can be placed at the mid-ocean
divergent boundaries where new magma is produced by 
mantle upwelling and a shallow melting zone. This new
or juvenile basaltic magma is the first phase of the
igneous portion of the cycle. It should be noted that
the least dense magma phases tend to be favored in 
eruptions. As the ridge spreads and the new rock is
carried away from the ridge, the interaction of 
heated circulating seawater through crevices starts
the initial retrograde metamorphism of the new rock.
<br/><br/><b><u>3. Subduction Zones</u></b><br/><br/> 
The Juan de Fuca plate sinks below the North America 
plate at the Cascadia subduction zone.The new basaltic 
oceanic crust eventually meets a subduction zone as it
moves away from the spreading ridge. As this crust is
pulled back into the mantle, the increasing pressure 
and temperature conditions cause a restructuring of the
mineralogy of the rock, this metamorphism alters the 
rock to form eclogite. As the slab of basaltic crust 
and some included sediments are dragged deeper, water 
and other more volatile materials are driven off and 
rise into the overlying wedge of rock above the 
subduction zone which is at a lower pressure. The 
lower pressure, high temperature, and now volatile 
rich material in this wedge melts and the resulting 
buoyant magma rises through the overlying rock to 
produce island arc or continental margin volcanism.
This volcanism includes more silicic lavas the 
further from the edge of the island arc or continental
margin, indicating a deeper source and a more 
differentiated magma.At times some of the 
metamorphosed downgoing slab may be thrust up or 
obducted onto the continental margin. These blocks
of mantleperidotite and the metamorphic eclogites 
are exposed as ophiolite complexes.The newly erupted 
volcanic material is subject to rapid erosion depending
on the climate conditions. These sediments accumulate 
within the basins on either side of an island arc. As
the sediments become more deeply buried lithification 
begins and sedimentary rock results.<br/><br/><b><u>
4. Continental collision</u></b><br/><br/> 
On the closing phase of the classic Wilson cycle, 
two continental or smaller terranes meet at a 
convergent zone. As the two masses of continental 
crust meet, neither can be subducted as they are 
both low density silicic rock. As the two masses 
meet, tremendous compressional forces distort and 
modify the rocks involved. The result is regional 
metamorphism within the interior of the ensuing 
orogeny or mountain building event. As the two 
masses are compressed, folded and faulted into 
a mountain range by the continental collision 
the whole suite of pre-existing igneous, volcanic,
sedimentary and earlier metamorphic rock units 
are subjected to this new metamorphic event.
<br/><br/><b><u>5. Accelerated erosion</u></b><br/><br/>
The high mountain ranges produced by continental 
collisions are immediately subjected to the forces 
of erosion. Erosion wears down the mountains and 
massive piles of sediment are developed in adjacent 
ocean margins, shallow seas, and as continental 
deposits. As these sediment piles are buried deeper
they become lithified into sedimentary rock. 
The metamorphic, igneous, and sedimentary rocks
of the mountains become the new piles of 
sediments in the adjoining basins and eventually 
become sedimentary rock.<br/><br/><b><u>6. An evolving 
process</u></b><br/><br/>The plate tectonics rock 
cycle is an evolutionary process. Magma generation, 
both in the spreading ridge environment and within 
the wedge above a subduction zone, favors the eruption 
of the more silicic and volatile rich fraction of the 
crustal or upper mantle material. This lower density 
material tends to stay within the crust and not be 
subducted back into the mantle. The magmatic aspects
of plate tectonics tends to gradual segregation 
within or between the mantle and crust. As magma 
forms, the initial melt is composed of the more 
silicic phases that have a lower melting point. 
This leads to partial melting and further segregation
of the lithosphere. In addition the silicic 
continental crust is relatively buoyant and 
is not normally subducted back into the mantle.
So over time the continental masses grow larger and larger.
