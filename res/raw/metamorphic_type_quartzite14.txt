<br/><br/><u><b>14.Quartzite</b></u><br/><br/>
Quartzite is a tough stone composed mostly of quartz.
 It may be derived from sandstone or from chert by regional
 metamorphism. 
 Quartzite forms in two different ways. In the first way, under
 the pressures and temperatures of deep burial, sandstone or chert 
recrystallizes resulting in a metamorphic rock. A quartzite in which 
all traces of the original grains and sedimentary structures are erased 
may also be called metaquartzite. This Las Vegas boulder is a metaquartzite.
 A quartzite that preserves some sedimentary features is best described as a
 metasandstone or metachert.The second way involves sandstone at low pressures
 and temperatures, where circulating fluids fill the spaces between sand grains
 with silica cement. This kind of quartzite, also called orthoquartzite, is considered
 a sedimentary rock, not a metamorphic rock, because the original mineral grains are still
 there and bedding planes and other sedimentary structures are still evident.
