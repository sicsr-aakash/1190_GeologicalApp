<br/><br/><u><b>4.Conglomerate</b></u><br/><br/>
Conglomerate could be thought of as a giant sandstone, 
containing grains of pebble size (greater than 4 mm) and cobble size (>64 mm).
Conglomerate forms in a very energetic environment, where rocks are eroded and
 carried downhill so swiftly that they aren't fully broken down into sand. 
Another name for conglomerate is puddingstone, especially if the large clasts
 are well rounded and the matrix around them is very fine sand or clay. 
These specimens could be called puddingstone.A conglomerate with jagged,
 broken clasts is usually called a breccia, and one that is poorly sorted 
and without rounded clasts is called a diamictite.Conglomerate is often much
 harder and resistant than the sandstones and shales that surround it.
