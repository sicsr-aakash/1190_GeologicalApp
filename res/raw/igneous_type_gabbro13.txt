<br/><br/><u><b>13.Gabbro</b></u><br/><br/>
Gabbro is a dark plutonic rock that is considered 
to be the plutonic equivalent of basalt.Unlike granite,
gabbro is low in silica and has no quartz; also gabbro
has no alkali feldspar, only plagioclase that has a 
high calcium content. The other dark minerals may 
include amphibole, pyroxene and sometimes biotite, 
olivine, magnetite, ilmenite and apatite.Gabbro is 
named after a town in Tuscany, Italy. You can get 
away with calling almost any dark, coarse-grained 
igneous rock gabbro, but true gabbro is a narrowly 
defined subset of dark plutonic rocks.Gabbro makes 
up most of the deep part of the oceanic crust, 
where melts of basaltic composition cool very slowly
to create large mineral grains. That makes gabbro a 
key sign of an ophiolite, a large body of oceanic 
crust that ends up on land. Gabbro is also found with
other plutonic rocks in batholiths when bodies of 
rising magma are low in silica.Igneous petrologists
are careful about their terminology for gabbro and 
similar rocks, in which "gabbroid," "gabbroic" and 
"gabbro" have distinct meanings.
