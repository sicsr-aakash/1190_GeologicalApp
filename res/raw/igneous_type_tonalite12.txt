 <br/><br/><u><b>12.Tonalite</b></u><br/><br/>
Tonalite is a widespread but uncommon plutonic rock,
a granitoid without alkali feldspar that may also be 
called plagiogranite and trondjhemite.The granitoids all 
center around granite, a fairly equal mixture of quartz, 
alkali feldspar and plagioclase feldspar. As you remove 
alkali feldspar from proper granite, it becomes 
granodiorite and then tonalite (dominantly plagioclase
with less than 10 percent K-feldspar). Recognizing 
tonalite takes a close look with a magnifier to be 
sure that alkali feldspar is truly absent and quartz
is abundant. Most tonalite also has abundant dark 
minerals, but this example is almost white 
(leucocratic), making it a plagiogranite. 
Trondhjemite is a plagiogranite whose dark mineral
is biotite. This specimen's dark mineral is pyroxene,
so it's plain old tonalite. See another example, with 
thin sections, at Ron Schott's Geology Home Companion 
blog.An extrusive rock (lava) with the composition of 
tonalite is classified as dacite. Tonalite gets its name
from the Tonales Pass in the Italian Alps, near Monte 
Adamello where it was first described along with quartz
monzonite (once known as adamellite).
