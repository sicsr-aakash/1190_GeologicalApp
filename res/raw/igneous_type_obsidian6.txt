<br/><br/><u><b>6.Obsidian</b></u><br/><br/>
Obsidian is an extrusive rock: lava that cooled without 
forming crystals, giving it a glassy texture Obsidian is 
an extreme variety of igneous rock with a glassy texture. 
Most popular accounts say that obsidian forms when lava 
cools very quickly, but that is not quite accurate. 
Obsidian starts with a lava very high in silica
(more than about 70 percent), such as a rhyolite. 
The many strong chemical bonds between silicon and 
oxygen make such a lava very viscous, but equally important
is that the temperature range between fully liquid 
(the liquidus) and fully solid (the solidus) is very small. 
Thus obsidian does not need to cool especially fast, because 
it solidifies especially fast.
