<br/><br/><u><b>11.Syenite</b></u><br/><br/>
Syenite is a plutonic rock consisting chiefly of 
potassium feldspar with a subordinate amount of 
plagioclase feldspar and little or no quartz.
The dark, mafic minerals in syenite tend to be 
amphibole minerals like hornblende. See its relation
to the other plutonic rocks in the QAP classification
diagram.Being a plutonic rock, syenite has large 
crystals from its slow underground cooling. An 
extrusive rock of the same composition as syenite
is called trachyte.Syenite is an ancient name derived 
from the city of Syene (now Aswan) in Egypt, where a
distinctive local stone was used for many of the
monuments there. However, the stone of Syene is not 
a syenite, but rather a dark granite or granodiorite 
with conspicuous reddish feldspar phenocrysts.
