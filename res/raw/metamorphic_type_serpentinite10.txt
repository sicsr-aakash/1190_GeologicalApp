<br/><br/><u><b>10.Serpentinite</b></u><br/><br/>
Serpentinite is composed of minerals of the serpentine group.
 It forms by regional metamorphism of deep-sea rocks from the
 oceanic mantle.
Serpentinite is common beneath the oceanic crust, where it forms
 by the alteration of the mantle rock peridotite. (See more about 
serpentinization and its importance in plate tectonics.)
 But it is seldom seen on land except in rocks from subduction zones,
 where oceanic rocks may be preserved.Most people call it serpentine
 (SER-penteen) or serpentine rock, but serpentine is the set of minerals 
that make up serpentinite (ser-PENT-inite). It gets its name from its resemblance
 to snakeskin, with a mottled color, waxy or resinous luster and curving, polished
 surfaces. Serpentinite is a sexy rock.
