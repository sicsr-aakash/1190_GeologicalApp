<br/><br/><u><b>2.Slate</b></u><br/><br/>
Slate is a low-grade metamorphic rock, with a dull luster and strong cleavage. 
It is derived from shale by regional metamorphism.
 Slate forms when shale, which consists of clay minerals, is put under pressure
 with temperatures of a few hundred degrees or so. Then the clays begin to revert 
to the mica minerals from which they formed. This does two things: first, the rock 
grows hard enough to ring or "tink" under the hammer, and second, the rock gets a 
pronounced cleavage direction, so that it breaks along flat planes. Slaty cleavage 
is not always in the same direction as the original sedimentary bedding planes,
 thus any fossils originally in the rock are usually erased, but sometimes they survive
 in smeared or stretched form.With further metamorphism, slate turns to phyllite, then to 
schist or gneiss.
