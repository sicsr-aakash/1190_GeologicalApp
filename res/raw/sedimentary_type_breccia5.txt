<br/><br/><u><b>5.Breccia</b></u><br/><br/>
Breccia is a rock made of smaller rocks,
like conglomerate. But breccia contains sharp, 
broken clasts while conglomerate has smooth, round clasts.
Breccia ("BRET-cha") is usually listed under sedimentary rocks,
 but igneous and metamorphic rocks may become shattered, too.
 It is safest to think of brecciation as a process rather than
 breccia as a rock type. As a sedimentary rock, breccia is a variety
 of conglomerate.There are many different ways to make breccia,
and usually geologists add a word to signify the kind of breccia 
they're talking about. A sedimentary breccia arises from things like
 talus or landslide debris. A volcanic or igneous breccia forms during 
eruptive activities.A collapse breccia forms when rocks are partly dissolved,
 such as limestone or marble. One created by tectonic activity is a fault breccia.
 And a new member of the family,first described from the Moon, is impact breccia. 
This specimen, in Upper Las Vegas Wash in Nevada, is probably a fault breccia.
