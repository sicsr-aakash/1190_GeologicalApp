<br/><br/><u><b>14.Rock Gypsum</b></u><br/><br/>
Rock gypsum is an evaporite rock that forms as shallow 
sea basins or salt lakes dry up enoughfor the mineral
 gypsum to come out of solution Gypsum forms bladed 
concretions called desert roses or sand roses, growing 
in sediments that are subjected to concentrated brines. 
The crystals grow from a central point, and the roses emerge
 when the matrix weathers away. They don't last long at the surface, 
just a few years, unless someone collects them. Besides gypsum, barite, 
celestine and calcite also form roses.
