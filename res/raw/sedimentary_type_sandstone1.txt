Sandstone forms where sand is laid down and buried &#45; beaches,
 dunes and seafloors. Usually sandstone is mostly quartz. 
andstone is a category of rock made from sediment The sediment 
particles are clasts, or pieces, of minerals and fragments of rock
 thus sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock.It is composed mostly of sand, 
which means particles of a medium size, so sandstone is a medium-grained clastic
 sedimentary rock. More precisely, sand is between 1/16 millimeter and 2 mm in 
size (silt is finer and gravel is coarser). Sandstone may include finer and coarser
 material and still be called sandstone,but if it includes more than 30 percent grains
 of gravel,cobble or boulder size it's classified instead as conglomerate or breccia
