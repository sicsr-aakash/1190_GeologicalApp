<br/><br/><u><b>8.Migmatite</b></u><br/><br/>
Migmatite is the same material as gneiss, but brought close to melting by 
regional metamorphism so that the veins and layers of minerals became warped and
 mixed.
Migmatite has been buried very deep and squeezed very hard. In many cases the darker 
part of the rock, consisting of biotite mica and hornblende, has been intruded by veins
 of lighter rock consisting of quartz and feldspar. With its curling light and dark veins, 
migmatite can be very picturesque. Yet even with this extreme degree of metamorphism, the 
minerals are arranged in layers and the rock is clearly classified as metamorphic.
