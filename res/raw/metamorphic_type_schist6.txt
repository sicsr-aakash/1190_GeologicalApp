<br/><br/><u><b>6.Schist</b></u><br/><br/>
Schist is formed by regional metamorphism and has schistose fabric  &#45;
it has coarse mineral = grains and is fissile, splitting in thin layers. 
Schist is a metamorphic rock that comes in almost infinite variety, but its main 
characteristic is hinted at in its name: schist comes from the ancient Greek for 
"split," through Latin and French. Schist is a rock formed by dynamic metamorphism 
at high temperatures and high pressures that aligns the grains of mica, hornblende 
and other flat or elongated minerals into thin layers, or foliation. At least 50 
percent of the mineral grains in schist are aligned this way (less than 50 percent 
smakes it gneiss). The rock may or may not be actually deformed in the direction
 of the foliation, although a strong foliation probably is a sign of high strain.
