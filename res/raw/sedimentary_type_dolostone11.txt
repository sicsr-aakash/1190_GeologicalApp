<br/><br/><u><b>11.Dolostone</b></u><br/><br/>
Dolomite rock, also sometimes called dolostone,
is usually a former limestone in which the mineral calcite is altered to dolomite.
Dolomite was first described bythe French mineralogist D&#x117;odat de Dolomieu in 1791 
from its occurrence in a range of the southern Alps. The rock was given the name 
dolomite by de Saussure,and today the mountains themselves are called the Dolomites.
What Dolomieu noticed was that dolomite looks like limestone, but unlike limestone 
it does not bubble when treated with weak acid. The mineral responsible is also called dolomite.
Dolomite is very significant in the petroleum business because it forms underground by the alteration
of calcite limestone. This chemical change is marked by a reduction in volume and by recrystallization,
which combine to produce open space (porosity) in the rock strata.
Porosity creates avenues for oil to travel and reservoirs for oil
to collect.Naturally,this alteration of limestone is called dolomitization, 
and the reverse alteration is called dedolomitization. 
Both are still somewhat mysterious problems in sedimentary geology.
