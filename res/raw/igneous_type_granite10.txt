<br/><br/><u><b>10.Granite</b></u><br/><br/>
Granite consists of quartz (gray), plagioclase feldspar 
(white) andalkali feldspar (beige) plus dark minerals, 
in this case biotite andhornblende."Granite" is used by
the public as a catch-all name for any light-colored,
coarse-grained igneous rock. The geologist examines 
these in the field and calls them granitoids pending 
laboratory tests. The key to true granite is that it 
contains sizable amounts of quartz and both kinds of 
feldspar. This article goes much deeper into granite.
This granite specimen comes from the Salinian block of 
central California, a chunk of ancient crust carried up
from southern California along the San Andreas fault.
Pictures of other granite specimens appear in the 
granite picture gallery. Also see the granite landforms
of Joshua Tree National Park.
