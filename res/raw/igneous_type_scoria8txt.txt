<br/><br/><u><b>8.Scoria</b></u><br/><br/>
Scoria, like pumice, is a lightweight extrusive rock, but
scoria has large, distinct gas bubbles and a darker color
Another name for scoria is volcanic cinders, and the 
landscaping product commonly called "lava rock" is scoria,
as is the cinder mix widely used on running tracks.
Scoria is more often a product of basaltic, low-silica 
lavas than of felsic, high-silica lavas. This is because
basalt is usually more fluid than felsite, allowing 
bubbles to grow larger before the rock freezes. Scoria
often forms as a frothy crust on lava flows that crumbles
off as the flow moves. It also is blown out of the crater
during eruptions. Unlike pumice, scoria usually has broken,
connected bubbles and does not float in water.This example
of scoria is from a cinder cone in northeastern California, 
at the edge of the Cascade Range.
