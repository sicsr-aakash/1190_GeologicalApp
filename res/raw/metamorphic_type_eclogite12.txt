<br/><br/><u><b>12.Eclogite</b></u><br/><br/>
Eclogite ("ECK-lo-jite") is an extreme metamorphic rock, formed by regiona
l metamorphism of basalt under very high pressures and temperatures. 
Eclogite is the name of highest-grade metamorphic facies.

 California, consists of high-magnesium pyrope garnet, green omphacite 
(a high-sodium/aluminum pyroxene), and deep-blue glaucophane (a sodium-rich amphibole).
 It was part of a subducting plate during Jurassic times, about 170 million years ago,
 when it formed. Much more recently, during the last few million years, it was raised and 
mixed into youngersubducted rocks of the Franciscan complex. The body of eclogite is no more
 than 100 meters across today.
