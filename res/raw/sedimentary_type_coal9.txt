<br/><br/><u><b>9.Coal</b></u><br/><br/>
Coal is fossilized peat, dead plant material that once piled 
deep on the bottom of ancient swamps.Coal differs from every
other kind of rock in that it is made of organic carbon: the actual remains, 
not just mineralized fossils, of dead plants.
Today the vast majority of dead plant matter is consumed by fire and decay, 
returning its carbon to the atmosphere as the gas carbon dioxide &#45; it is oxidized.
The carbon in coal, however, was preserved from oxidation and remains in a chemically reduced form,
available for oxidation.Coal geologists study coal just the way other geologists study other rocks.
But instead of talking about the minerals that make up the rock (because there are none,
just bits of organic matter), coal geologists refer to the macerals, of which there are three groups: 
inertinite, liptinite, and vitrinite. To oversimplify a complex subject,
inertinite is generally derived from plant tissues, 
liptinite from pollen and resins, and vitrinite from humus or broken-down plant matter.
