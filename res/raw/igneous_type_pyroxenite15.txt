<br/><br/><u><b>15.Pyroxenite</b></u><br/><br/>
Pyroxenite is a plutonic rock that consists of dark
minerals in the pyroxene group plus a little olivine 
or amphibole minerals.Pyroxenite belongs to the ultramafic
group, meaning that it consists almost entirely of dark 
minerals rich in iron and magnesium. Specifically, its 
silicate minerals are mostly pyroxenes rather than the 
other mafic minerals, olivine and amphibole. In the field,
pyroxene crystals display a stubby shape and square 
cross-section whereas amphiboles have a lozenge-shaped 
cross-section.Pyroxenite is often associated with its 
ultramafic cousin peridotite. Rocks like these originate
deep in the seafloor, underneath the basalt that makes 
up the upper oceanic crust. They occur on land where 
slabs of oceanic crust become attached to continents, 
that is, at subduction zones.Identifying this specimen, 
from the Feather River Ultramafics of the Sierra Nevada, 
was largely a process of elimination. It attracts a 
magnet, probably due to fine-grained magnetite, but 
the visible minerals are translucent with a strong cleavage. 
I was reliably informed that the locality contained 
ultramafics. Greenish olivine and black hornblende are
absent, and the hardness of 5.5 also ruled out these 
minerals as well as the feldspars. Without large crystals,
a blowpipe and chemicals for simple lab tests, or the 
ability to make thin sections, this is as far as the amateur
can go sometimes.
