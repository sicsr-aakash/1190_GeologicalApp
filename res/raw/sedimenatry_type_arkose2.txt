<br/><br/><u><b>2.Arkose</b></u><br/><br/>
Arkose is a raw, coarse-grained sandstone, deposited very near
 its source, that consists of quartz and a significant
 proportion of feldspar.Arkose is known to be young because of
 its content of feldspar, a mineral that usually degrades quickly
into clay.Its mineral grains are generally angular rather than 
smooth and rounded, another sign that they were transported only 
a short distance from their origin. Arkose usually has a reddish color
 from feldspar, clay and iron oxides &#45; ingredients that are uncommon in
 ordinary sandstone. (about sandstone)Arkose is similar to graywacke, 
which is also a rock laid down near its source. But whereas graywacke 
forms in a seafloor setting,arkose generally forms on land or near shore
 specifically from the rapid breakdown of granitic rocks.
