<br/><br/><u><b>10.Limestone</b></u><br/><br/>
Limestone is usually made of the tiny calcite skeletons of microscopic 
organisms that once lived in shallow seas like today's Bahamas.Limestone 
dissolves in rainwater more easily than other rocks. Rainwater picks up a 
small amount of carbon dioxide during its passage through the air,and that 
turns it into a very weak acid.
Calcite is vulnerable to acid. That explains why underground caverns
tend to form in limestone country,and why limestone buildings suffer from acid rainfall.
In dry regions, limestone is a resistant rock that forms some impressive mountains.
Under pressure, limestone metamorphoses into marble. Under gentler conditions 
that are still not completely understood,the calcite in limestone is altered to 
dolomite, changing it to dolomite rock.
