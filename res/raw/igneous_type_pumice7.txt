<br/><br/><u><b>7.Pumice</b></u><br/><br/>
Pumice is basically lava froth, an extrusive rock frozen
as its dissolved gases come out of solution. It looks 
solid but often floats on water.This pumice specimen is 
from the Oakland Hills in northern California and reflects 
the high-silica (felsic) magmas that form when subducted 
marine crust mixes with granitic continental crust. Pumice
may look solid, but it's full of small pores and spaces and
weighs very little. Pumice is easily crushed and used for 
abrasive grit or soil amendments.Pumice is much like scoria
in that both are frothy, lightweight volcanic rocks, but the
bubbles in pumice are small and regular and its composition 
is more felsic than scoria's. Also, pumice is generally glassy 
whereas scoria is a more typical lava with microscopic crystals.
