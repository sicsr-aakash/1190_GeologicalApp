<br/><br/><u><b>14.Peridotite</b></u><br/><br/>
Peridotite is the plutonic rock beneath the Earth's 
crust, in the upper part of the mantle. It is named 
for peridot, the gemstone name of olivine.Peridotite 
(per-RID-a-tite) is very low in silicon and high in 
iron and magnesium, a combination called ultramafic. 
It doesn't have enough silicon to make the minerals 
feldspar or quartz, only mafic minerals like olivine
and pyroxene. These dark and heavy minerals make 
peridotite much denser than most rocks.Where lithospheric
plates pull apart, along the midocean ridges, the 
release of pressure on the peridotite mantle allows 
it to partially melt. That melted portion, richer in
silicon and aluminum, rises to the surface as basalt.
This peridotite boulder is partially altered to 
serpentine minerals, but it has visible grains of 
pyroxene sparkling in it as well as serpentine veins. 
Most peridotite is metamorphosed intoserpentinite during
the processes of plate tectonics, but sometimes it 
survives to appear in subduction-zone rocks like the 
rocks of Shell Beach, California.
