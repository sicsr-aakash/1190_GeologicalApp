<br/><br/><u><b>9.Porphyry</b></u><br/><br/>
Porphyry ("PORE &#45; fer &#45; ee") is a name used for any igneous
rock with conspicuous larger grains &#45; phenocrysts &#45; floating
in a fine-grained groundmass.Geologists use the term 
porphyry only with a word in front of it describing the
composition of the groundmass. This image, for instance,
shows an andesite porphyry. The fine-grained part is 
andesite and the phenocrysts are light alkali feldspar
and dark biotite. Geologists also may call this an 
andesite with porphyritic texture. That is, "porphyry"
refers to a texture, not a composition, just as "satin"
refers to a type of fabric rather than the fiber it's 
made from (see the various igneous rock textures).
The phenocryst gallery shows some of the different 
minerals that are found as phenocrysts. See other 
examples of porphyritic texture in the volcanic rocks
gallery. A porphyry may be plutonic, intrusive or extrusive
