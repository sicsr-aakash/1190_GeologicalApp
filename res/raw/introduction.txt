Have you ever wondered what the world would be like without rocks? 
You may not know it, but if we took all the rocks away, we would have
a miserable life. We use rocks for roads, metals, jewelry, tombstones, 
building materals, cosmetics, and many, many more things. 
Most of the famous sculptures of the world are made from blocks of 
stones such as granite and marble. Did you know that the Great Wall of 
China and the Taj Mahal are made out of rocks? We also collect rocks as 
a hobby. If we did not have rocks, this earth would be pretty empty. Who
wants an empty earth? Not me!
