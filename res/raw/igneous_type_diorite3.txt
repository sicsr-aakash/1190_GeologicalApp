<br/><br/><u><b>3.Diorite</b></u><br/><br/>
Diorite is a plutonic rock that is something between 
granite andgabbro. It consists mostly of white plagioclase
feldspar and blackhornblende.Unlike granite, diorite has
no or very little quartz or alkali feldspar. Unlike 
gabbro, diorite contains sodic, not calcic plagioclase. 
Typically, sodic plagioclase is the bright white variety 
albite, giving diorite a high-relief look. If a dioritic 
rock is erupted from a volcano (that is, if it is extrusive), 
it cools into andesite lava.In the field, geologists may 
call a black-and-white rock diorite, but true diorite is 
not very common. With a little quartz, diorite becomes 
quartz diorite, and with more quartz it becomestonalite. 
With more alkali feldspar, diorite becomes monzonite. 
With more of both minerals, diorite becomes granodiorite.
