<br/><br/><u><b>7.Chert</b></u><br/><br/>
Chert is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral
 chalcedony &#45; cryptocrystalline silica,or quartz in crystals 
of submicroscopic size.Chert can form in parts of the deep sea 
where the tiny shells of siliceous organisms are concentrated, 
or elsewhere where underground fluids replace sediments with silica.
 Chert nodules also occur in limestones. Learn more about chert.
This piece of chert that I found in the Mojave Desert shows chert's
 typical clean conchoidal fracture and waxy luster.Chert may have a high 
clay content and look at first glance like shale, but its greater hardness
 gives it away. Also, the waxy luster of chalcedony combines with the earthy 
appearance of clay to give it the look of broken chocolate. Chert grades into
 siliceous shale or siliceous mudstone.Chert is a more inclusive term than flint
 or jasper, two other cryptocrystalline silica rocks.
