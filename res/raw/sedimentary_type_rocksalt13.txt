Rock salt is an evaporite composed mostly of the mineral halite, 
source of table salt, as well as sylvite. Learn more about salt
The sea takes in dissolved matter from two sources, rivers that 
enter it and volcanic activity on the seafloor. The rivers provide 
mainly ions &#45; unpaired atoms with a lack or an excess of electrons &#45; from 
the weathering of rocks. The major ions are various silicates, various carbonates,
plus the alkali metals sodium, calcium and potassium. The seafloor 
volcanoes provide mainly hydrogen and chloride ions. All of these mix and match:
sea organisms build shells from calcium carbonate and silica, clay minerals take
up potassium, the hydrogen is snapped up in lots of different places. 
After all the electron swapping is done, sodium ion (from rivers) and chloride
ion (from volcanoes) are the two survivors.
