<br/><br/><u><b>5.Felsite</b></u><br/><br/>
Felsite is a general name for light-colored extrusive 
igneous rocks. Ignore the dark dendritic growths on this 
specimen's surface.Felsite is fine grained but not glassy, 
and it may or may not have phenocrysts (large mineral grains).
It is high in silica or felsic, typically consisting of the
minerals quartz, plagioclase feldspar and alkali feldspar. 
Felsite is usually called the extrusive equivalent of granite.
A common felsitic rock is rhyolite, which typically has 
phenocrysts and signs of having flowed. Felsite should not 
be confused with tuff, a rock made up of compacted volcanic 
ash that can also be light colored.
