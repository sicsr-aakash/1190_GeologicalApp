<br/><br/><u><b>1.Andesite</b></u><br/><br/>
Andesite is an extrusive or intrusive igneous rock that
is higher in silica than basalt and lower than rhyolite 
or felsite.In general, color is a good clue to the silica
content of lavas, with basalt being dark and felsite 
being light. Although geologists would do a chemical 
analysis before identifying andesite in a published paper,
in the field they readily call a gray or medium-red lava 
andesite. Andesite gets its name from the Andes mountains 
of South America, where arc volcanic rocks mix basaltic magma
with granitic crustal rocks, yielding lavas with intermediate
compositions. Andesite is less fluid than basalt and erupts 
with more violence, because its dissolved gases cannot escape
as easily. Andesite is considered the extrusive equivalent of 
diorite.<br/><br/>
