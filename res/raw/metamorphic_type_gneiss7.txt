<br/><br/><u><b>7.Gneiss</b></u><br/><br/>
Gneiss ("nice") is a rock of great variety with large mineral grains
 arranged in wide bands. It means a type of rock texture, not a composition.
Gneiss is a typical rock type formed by regional metamorphism, in which a sedimentary 
or igneous rock has been deeply buried and subjected to high temperatures and pressures
. Nearly all traces of the original structures (including fossils) and fabric (such as 
layering and ripple marks) are wiped out as the minerals migrate and recrystallize. 
The streaks contain minerals, like hornblende, that don't occur in sedimentary rocks.
In gneiss, less than 50 percent of the minerals are aligned in thin, foliated layers.
 You can see that unlike schist, which is more strongly aligned, gneiss doesn't fracture
 along the planes of the mineral streaks. And thicker veins of large-grained minerals 
form in it, unlike the more evenly layered appearance of schist. With still more metamorphism,
 gneisses can turn to migmatite and then totally recrystallize into granite.
