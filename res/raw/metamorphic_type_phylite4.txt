<br/><br/><u><b>4.Phylite</b></u><br/><br/>
Phyllite is one step beyond slate in the chain of regional metamorphism.
 Unlike slate, phyllite has a definite sheen.
Phyllite is from scientific Latin and means "leaf-stone." It's typically a
 medium-gray or greenish stone,but here sunlight reflects off its finely wavy 
face.Whereas slate has a dull surface because its metamorphic minerals are extremely fine grained,
 phyllite has a sheen from tiny grains of sericitic mica, graphite, chlorite and similar minerals,
 because with further heat and pressure, the reflective grains grow more abundant and join each other.
 And whereas slate usually breaks in very flat sheets,phyllite tends to have a corrugated cleavage.
