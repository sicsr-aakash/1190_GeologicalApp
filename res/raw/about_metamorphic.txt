<br/><br/><b><u>1.How to Tell Metamorphic Rocks</u></b><br/><br/>
The main thing about metamorphic rocks is that they are shaped 
by great heat and pressure. The following traits are all related to that.
<ul><li>Because their mineral grains grew together tightly 
during metamorphism, they're generally strong rocks</li>
<li>They're made of different minerals than other kinds of 
rocks and have a wide range of color and luster.</li>
<li>They generally show signs of stretching or squeezing, 
giving them a striped appearance.</li></ul>
<br/><br/><b><u>2.Origin of Metamorphic Rocks</u></b><br/><br/>
Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing 
rock types, in a process called metamorphism, 
which means "change in form". The original rock (protolith) is
subjected to heat (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 C)
and pressure (1500 bars), causing profound physical and/or 
chemical change. The protolith may be sedimentary rock, igneous
rock or another older metamorphic rock.Metamorphic rocks make up
a large part of the Earth's crust and are classified by texture 
and by chemical and mineral assemblage (metamorphic facies). They 
may be formed simply by being deep beneath the Earth's surface,
subjected to high temperatures and the great pressure of the rock 
layers above it. They can form from tectonic processes such as
continental collisions, which cause horizontal pressure, friction and
distortion. They are also formed when rock is heated up by 
the intrusion of hot molten rock called magma from the Earth's interior. 
The study of metamorphic rocks (now exposed at the Earth's 
surface following erosion and uplift) provides information about the 
temperatures and pressures that occur at great depths within the 
Earth's crust. Some examples of metamorphic rocks are gneiss, slate, 
marble, schist, and quartzite.
<br/><br/><b><u>3.Where Metamorphic Rocks Are Found</u></b>
<br/><br/>If you live in an area where you have a lot of earth quakes,
you may notice a type of rock that you have not seen in your yard before. 
The metamorphic rock can be found on the Earth's surface after such a quake.
They can also be found in the Earth's crust.
