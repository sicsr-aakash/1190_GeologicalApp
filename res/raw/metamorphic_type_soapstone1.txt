Soapstone consists largely of the mineral talc with or without other metamorphic
 minerals, derived from hydrothemal alteration of peridotite and related ultramafic
 rocks. Harder examples are suitable for making carved objects. Soapstone kitchen 
counters or table tops are highly resistant to stains and cracking.
