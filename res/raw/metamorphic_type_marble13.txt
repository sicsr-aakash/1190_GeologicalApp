<br/><br/><u><b>13.Marble</b></u><br/><br/>
Marble is made by regional metamorphism of limestone or dolomite rock,
 causing their microscopic grains to combine into larger crystals.
Marble consists of recrystallized calcite (in limestone) or dolomite
 (in dolomite rock). In this hand specimen of Vermont marble, the crystals
 are small. For fine marble of the sort used in buildings and sculpture, the
 crystals are even smaller. The color of marblecan range from the purest white
 to black, ranging through the warmer colors in between depending on the other 
mineral impurities.Like other metamorphic rocks, marble has no fossils, and any
 layering that appears in it probably does not correspond to the original bedding 
of the precursor limestone. And like limestone, marble tends to dissolve in acidic 
fluids. It is quite durable in dry climates, as in the Mediterranean countries where
 ancient marble structures survive.
